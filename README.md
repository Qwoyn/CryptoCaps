## Getting Started

The easiest way of accessing the buyToken function which allows you to create a post on the ethereum blockchain is to visit
[Qwoyn](https://qwoyn.io/CryptoCaps) . We are currently using the Ropsten testnet so please make sure metamask is connected to
Ropsten instead of the main network.

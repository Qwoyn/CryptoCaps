Document ideas and items on the ethereum classic blockchain using an NFT smart contract.  This smart contract is
an easy way for users to interact with the Ethereum blockchain.  Web interface is still under construction but the contract
is fully functional and accessible via the instructions below. We've written an article at Medium.com explaining how to 
deploy your own erc721 token using this smart contract as an example.  [View it on Medium](https://medium.com/@danpittman_41978/building-an-erc721-non-fungible-token-smart-contract-and-using-metamask-to-interact-with-it-via-a-59583f0dd6c1)

## Getting Started

The easiest way of accessing the buyToken function which allows you to create a post on the ethereum blockchain is to visit
[Qwoyn](https://qwoyn.io/CryptoCaps).  We are currently using the Ropsten testnet so please make sure metamask is connected to
Ropsten instead of the main network.
